# Ember-cli Google Maps Integration

This is a repository built along with my tutorial:
[Google Maps Integration: Ember CLI Edition](http://blog.atmartin.io/google-maps-integration-ember-cli-edition/)


Feel free to follow along yourself, or to fork this repo and use it as a base for your projects.

This code and its associated tutorial is inspired by [this post](http://strongpoint.io/blog/2014/07/28/ember-js-writing-google-maps-component-part-1/) by [Jan Votava](http://twitter.com/elektronek). Thanks, Jan!
